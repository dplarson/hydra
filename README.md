# Hydra
[Hydra](https://github.com/sdegutis/hydra) is windows manager for OSX created by [sdegutis](https://github.com/sdegutis). I like the app, but some of the recent changes have me a bit concerned about its future. Since I just want to use Hydra for resizing windows, I've created this fork for my personal use.

## Building the app

1. perform a clean build of the app: ``make``
2. install the compiled app: ``cp build/Release/Hydra.app /Applications/``
3. enable ``Hydra.app``: System Preferences >> Security & Privacy >> Privacy >> Accessibility >> Hydra.app
